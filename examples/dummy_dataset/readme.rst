Example Data
===================

This example dataset is a NetCDF4 dataset with the spatial dimensions compressed into a single dimension for the the Central Otago region of New Zealand.  It comprises 4 spatial tiles which each have modified ERA5-land Total precipitation
data for 2000-07-01 to 2003-06-30.
The data is reported as 7 day mean precipitation in mm/day,  Note that each year is assumed to be 364 days (52 weeks).
Therefore the additional 1-2 days as simply excluded. The missing days are 2003-06-30 for non-leap years and  2003-06-29 and 2003-06-30.

For internal reference and debugging the dataset was generated by: ../komanawa-nz-lsr/runs/make_dummy_dataset/make_dummy_dataset.py
